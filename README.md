## Python Projects

### Analyzing Kagglers By Data Roles
**`Notebook:`** [Analyzing Kagglers By Data Roles](https://nbviewer.org/github/omarstinner/Projects/blob/9329a401a5cc468fabad110a66229ac30fb413b9/Analyzing%20Kagglers%20By%20Data%20Role.ipynb)<br />
**`Description:`** This study aims to explore the various job roles within the field of data by analyzing a survey conducted by Kaggle. The dataset in this project contains 20,036 surveyees, of whom we will examine against several factors such as  “formal educational level” and “years of programming experience”. To better understand the various aspects of each job role, we will develop an analytical view of the data field job market to inform insights.

**`Description:`** This project aims to analyze the average SAT scores of high schools from the five boroughs of New York City. We will explore how the factors in each neighborhood influence the average SAT score of high schools. We will be specifically looking at the correlations and relationships between average SAT scores and demographic factors such as high school racial proportions.

### Exploring Employee Exit Surveys
**`Notebook:`** [Exploring Employee Exit Surveys](https://nbviewer.org/github/omarstinner/Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb)<br />

**`Notebook:`** [Exploring the Euro-US Dollar Exchange Rate Over The Years](https://github.com/omarstinner/Projects/blob/main/Exploring%20the%20Euro-US%20Dollar%20Exchange%20Rate%20Over%20The%20Years.ipynb)<br />
**`Description:`** This project studies the Euro-US Dollar exchange rates over different time periods. The aim of this project is to visualize the exchange rates over such time periods and clearly show the fluctuations in the  Euro-US Dollar exchange rates. We specifically highlight moments when the US-Dollar is either stronger or weaker than the Euro. The main part of this project centers on the “period_selector” function which aims to simulate an exchange rate chart you would find on xe.com.

### Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on the I-94
**`Notebook:`** [Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on the I-94](https://nbviewer.org/github/omarstinner/Projects/blob/main/Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20the%20I-94.ipynb)<br />
**`Description:`** This project aims to understand the factors influencing high traffic volumes on Interstate 94. We will be mainly focusing our analysis on specifically understanding the effects of two factors: “weather” and “time”.  The data collected for this project is solely based on westbound traffic (east to west), meaning conclusions drawn cannot be generalized for the whole Interstate.

### Exploring eBay Car Listings
**`Notebook:`** [Exploring eBay Car Listings](https://nbviewer.org/github/omarstinner/Projects/blob/main/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)<br />
**`Description:`** This project explores the different characteristics of car listings on "eBay Kleineanzeigen" - A German Marketplace used for selling various items and used cars.

The two types of posts we will be looking at are: “Ask HN” posts - posts that ask the Hacker News community a question, and “Show HN” posts - posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or generally something interesting. We will be specifically looking to find which type of poss receives more comments on average and if posts receive more comments on average at specific times.

### Finding Profitable Mobile Application Opportunities
**`Notebook:`** [Finding Profitable Mobile Application Opportunities](https://nbviewer.org/github/omarstinner/Projects/blob/main/Profitable%20App%20Profiles.ipynb)<br />
**`Description:`** The aim of this project is to search for a profitable mobile application opportunity for a mobile application developer client on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Our client is only interested in developing free applications and generating profit through in-app ads, limiting our analysis to free applications. To find a profitable application opportunity, we will be looking for applications that generate a lot of traffic.
